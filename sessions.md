#### We talked about

- Anki and modeling your knowledge
- Source control, Git and GitHub

#### Git tutorials research

- [What is Git - A Quick Introduction to the Git Version Control System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqmSzXDrJBk)  
Start with this one. It's a very short, just to the point overview.


- [1.1: Introduction - Git and GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY)  
- [1.2: Branches - Git and GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPpnCh7InLY)  
These two look very nice. I didn't finish them but they are very promising. Tell me if it worths the time.


- [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)  
Read this, but don't do it. We will do it together.


#### Other

- [How I Learned to Code in 6 Months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IlaxZf3-s8)  
An interesting talk. It is a bit about how crazy the project we are about to is. But a bit inspiring as well.
